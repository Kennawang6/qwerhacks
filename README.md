## Purpose
QWER Films

## How It Works
This is a web app built with React.js. The intention is to store data of each movie with queer characters and experiences using Google Firestore. This data would include basic information and statistics about LGBTQIA+ representation. For sake of the demo though, we used a local copy of the movie information and used data that did not have advanced statistics about representation.

## Future Improvements
We have several features and improvements we wanted to accomplish if we had more time to work on this project. We would want to find more sources of data for the movies so that we can offer insights on the quality of the representation, such as number of queer characters, if those queer characters are main characters and if the actors playing the characters are also queer.
Identity is intersectional, so information that's gathered about each movie should not be limited to gender and sexuality, but also class, race, ability, and other experiences people may have.
There is also room for adding a social aspect to the app. Some possibilities included to connect users to other users with the same tastes in movies, discussion forums for each movie, and
Extending to TV shows and music.

## Other Notes
We started off by adapting [code](https://github.com/malsf21/qwerhacks-web-dev-workshop) from a web development workshop run by Matt Wang.
